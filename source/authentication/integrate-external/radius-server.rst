RADIUS
======

You can configure Policy Server to integrate with existing external RADIUS Server for User Authentication. When a user is authenticated through a captive web portal or an agent, the user password is authenticated through a RADIUS server.

#. Go to **Preferences** in the top panel
#. Go to **User Authentication > Authentication Integration** in the left Preferences panel

Under **RADIUS Server**

#. For **Server Address**, enter the RADIUS server's IP Address or FQDN.
#. For **Server Port**, enter the RADIUS server's port (Default is 1812)
#. For **Shared Secret Key**, enter the pre-shared secret key for RADIUS authentication.
#. Click **Update**
