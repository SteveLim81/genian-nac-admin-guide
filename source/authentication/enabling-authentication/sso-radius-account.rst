Single Sign-On via RADIUS Accounting
====================================

If user authentication through RADIUS is applied to the network, user authentication can be automatically performed through accounting packet provided by RADIUS client such as Access Point.
Genian NAC receives external RADIUS accounting packets, saves them as audit records, and uses them as user authentication information.
