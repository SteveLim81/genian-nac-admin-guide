Configuring Captive Web Portal
==============================

A **Captive Web Portal** (**CWP**) is a ‘landing’ web page, often used to present a landing or log-in page. The portal intercepts observed packets until such time as the user is authorized to launch browser sessions. The user is granted conditional Internet or Network access once Authentication, EULA Agreement, Payment, or other valid credentials have been agreed upon


Design Template
---------------

You can create many custom CWP's from the Design Template or use the default Standard Template to enable and disable CWP functions.
