Configuring Guest Management
============================

You can manage Guests on the Policy Server by establishing a limited-privileged account that permits temporary access onto your network. Your guests can also send requests for access using credentials they submit for you to approve or deny. You can manually create, group, and delete guest credentials as needed depending on your requirements.
