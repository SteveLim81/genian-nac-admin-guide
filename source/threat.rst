Detecting Threats
-----------------

.. note:: This feature required Professional or Enterprise Edition

A **Threat** may exploit vulnerabilities of a device, group of devices, or to breach network security and therefore cause possible damage.
A **Vulnerability** is an opening that can be exploited by threats to cause damage to a device, group of devices, or to network security.

Genian NAC inspects network traffic to identify abnormalities in the network and marks endpoint devices that have Threats. You can configure
custom **Threat Definitions** or use the seven pre-defined definitions provided by default to detect endpoint devices that are exposed to
major threats such as **Ad-Hoc Networks, ARP Bombing, ARP Spoofing, MAC+IP Clones, Port Scanning** and more.
