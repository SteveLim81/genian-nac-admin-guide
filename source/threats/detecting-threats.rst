Detecting Threats
=================
 
Once the configured **Threat Definition** is assigned to the **Node Policy** you would like to apply, a threat will be almost immediately detected either by a **Network Sensor** or by an **Agent**. 
You may see the results in a variety of ways. 

   - Find **Threat** column in **Node Management**
   - Edit Node View for **Threat View**
   - Trace **Threat Logs**
   - Glance **Dashabord Widget** for **Threat** tab
   - Filter **Status & Filters**

Furthermore, you can be notified about any pre-defined threats that are detected. 

For notifying a user about the threats detected, please see :doc:`/logs/notification-event`
