Installing Agent
================

**Agent** not only assists in determining the posture of the endpoint device, but can also collect system information, access control, 
and authenticate users. The Agent can be installed onto **Windows** and **MacOS** either manually or by **Agent Not Installed Enforcement** 
Policy. Once installed, the Agent then communicates with the Policy Server keeping device compliant with policies.
